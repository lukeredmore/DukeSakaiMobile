The &quot;Final&quot; assignment and &quot;Final_companion&quot; assignment. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&gt; The primary &quot;Final&quot; assignment provides a copy of all the same questions presented in the paper exam, but with text boxes that allow you to input your answers for each question. This is the primary method of grading, allowing us to &quot;automatically&quot; filter out most correct answers.<\/li>\n\t<li>&gt; The  &quot;Final_companion&quot; includes a PDF of the test and the whole equation sheet, as well as the traditional submission method (print, complete, scan, label, submit). This is secondary mode of grading that will allow us to provide partial credit based on work and adjustability with unfamiliar formats and equivalent solutions.<\/li>\n\t<li>&gt; Technical logistics such as typing time, submission, and printing have been accounted when setting up the test-timing. <\/li>\n\t<li>&gt; For Questions that require no work or &quot;long-response&quot; typed responses are preferred since they are easier to grade. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Proctoring will be via Zoom.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&gt; All students must keep their camera\/mic on for the duration of the exam. Please find a comfortable and quiet place to test. <\/li>\n\t<li>&gt; Any questions you have for Dr.C (material) and I (technical) will be through the private chat.

BUT! The math still works. The solution you will get will have poles on the imaginary axis. The right of the imaginary axis we know we have an ROC defining a strictly causal\/rightfacing signal and to the left, a strictly anticausal\/leftfacing signal. Given our definition of periodicity, our signal should be ever-present, not fitting in either of these groups, so what gives?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWell, the Laplace transform of a truly periodic signal does not really exist...<br \/>\n<br \/>\nInstead, the solution spits out a X(s) that corresponds to two functions-- one ROC that would corresponding to the right facing component, and another that would correspond with the left facing component. Both of which may seem like their missing information... at first. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn reality, the information in a periodic signal is REDUNDANT. As we saw with the FS, we could learn everything we want about a periodic signal by looking at a single period. That would mean to reason that we would definitely know everything given the full right facing component. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis moves into a moderately controversial area of mathematics that gets uglier the deeper we go with predicate convergence, ordinary points and other mathy weirdness... but we are engineers. Same information is present, so we don't see anything broken. But this is another thing, like with the delta function, that will spark debate between us, the physicist and mathematicians. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt's a cool thought experiment if you want to dive into it, but for the point of this HW, feel free to assume convergence and test those assumptions.

In the meantime, Dr. Collins and I do provide additions office hours by appointment and by request. Just send us an email and we can put something together.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Fully Worked Complex Examples.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>While fully worked example of practical “real-life” problems that are generally more involved than what you see on the HW and working through “non-toy” examples akin to your HW is not something that is allotted for within the instructional time in class based on curriculum requirement, both are very useful in building an intuition for this type of material, but more so that intuition is built by doing rather than observation. That being said, I’ve talked to Dr. C and she has offered to record extra lectures running through some more “realistic” convolution and\/or frequency domain information. I may also jump on this train to approach the example from a different direction (e.g. Audio processing or circuits) if time allows.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tRelating to difficulty as perceived, concerns about set-up and how to get started, there is something we have to note here that may be new compared to previous classes you have had. The work in this class (and many higher level engineering courses) will often be non-state-dependent, meaning that with much of this material, there is more than one way to reach the answer, and often, there are many equally valid ways to express the same answer. For this reason, there isn’t a single one-size-fits-all set up for all questions. Some questions are more well suited to different approaches and preference of those approaches vary drastically from individual to individual. Some people prefer exploiting properties and known identities ad nauseam, some like to just run headfirst into integration, and others leverage graphical and “trick” methods, and even within that divide, the actual path of operation may vary drastically. Different problems and different people prefer different things, and generally the starting point provided in the HW problems is set-up all up until that divergence occurs. The intention is that you try stuff, get stuck, and possibly try to approach the problem from a different angle (e.g. Analysis equation looks hard for this problem, let me try working backwards with the synthesis equation or look at my equation sheet). Math errors, if not conceptual, should only be minor a deduction since we are more interested in whether you can conceptually try and approach these problems, which is generally held in your work and methodology. Our goal is for you to find how you specifically best approach each of these tasks. That is the main component of this course that will translate into the courses that follow more so than any given formula or notation.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tAs a benchmark, we design the HW to take between 1.5-3 hours a week (excluding HW4 which was intended to be 10-20 minutes per part for spring break) and we typically try and scale the difficulty from simple\/easier to more complex problems as you proceed through the assignment (with a few pace-breaking exceptions) requiring only material that has been covered prior to the assignment release date. More time can be expected if the topic is just “not clicking”, but if the work seems unbearable or excessive or you’re getting stuck, that may be an indication that you are approaching a given problem in a way that is not the best for you. You’re not dumb. You didn’t mess up. You just went the different direction at the divergence and are now on a different path. It’s going to the same location but might have a few hurdles that you don’t like. At that point you can either try and rough it out and explore the “hard way” or step back and take a second look for another way to approach it. Either way, my recommendation to get started is to jump in and try stuff. As your intuition grows, you’ll be more directional in how you approach different problems, but for now, don’t be afraid of jumping to trial-and-error of methodology when figuring out what works best for you.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tAlong those lines, don’t fall into the trap of analysis paralysis and default to however a given member of Team280 (including myself) approaches a problem. Our goal at office hours is by working with you to find what method works best specifically for you, not to give you answers or work the problems out for you. We will help show you new ways to do it, and we are eager to happy to help you, but we won’t be sitting next to you on test day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. Conceptual difficulty with Fourier Series\/Transform and Convolution.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There is some addition conceptualized explanation included at the end of the Extra Credit assignment if you'd like to check that out, but it does get pretty far into the weeds with high-level mathematics, generalizations, and information theory that are beyond the expectation of this class. I'm seeing if I can put together a couple more human\/tangible explanations of what each of the things do and why they are what they are. Since we work with general &quot;signals&quot; in this class, a lot of times these explanation can vary based on application. At their heart, both are Fourier Series\/Transform and Convolution are mathematical tools that make engineering problems (generic systems) easier to solve or analyze, but I can try and throw some physical or application-specific manifestation at you all to see if it makes easier to &quot;see it&quot; in a new light and build an intuition. I'll try and set up a video lecture\/office hours to go over other ways to look at\/experience the Frequency Domain and Convolution. In the meantime, here is a little sample:<br \/>\n\t \n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>:: Convolution is a mathematical operation akin to multiplication, sharing many properties with multiplication. It originally arose in physics\/mathematics as a common way to express the general solution to different linear differential equations (specifically D'Alembert's solution to the wave equation and analysis of the Taylor Series), but since then, its uses have expanded across mathematics to stats to computer science to engineering (not in that order). In the scope of Signal Processing, it often just &quot;pops up&quot; (such as when when we find the Fourier transform of amplitude modulated signals or process additive noise), but it is also leveraged as a tool to perform a single very useful function -- modelling or using an LTI system, generally for the purpose of filtering. The manifestation of these again varies based on what type of signal we are processing (e.g. audio v.s. visual v.s. biomedical) and what type of system we are using (e.g. mechanical v.s. electrical v.s. biological), but the math stays the same. A few really common examples that you may have experienced are in image processing (applying blur or sharpening\/edge-detection filters) or in audio either with explicit filtering\/EQ\/Equalizing\/Mixing or with reverb\/delay.<br \/>\n\t\t<br \/>\n\t\tWithout applying too much ECE-specific processing, you can hear &quot;convolution happening&quot; with acoustic reverb. Next time you're in a large room (like one of our auditoriums, Cameron Stadium or Duke Chapel), do one hard clap. That is an impulse. You will notice that the sound lingers -- that is the impulse response. Most acoustic responses are linear, so in theory (and application) you could record and convolve that impulse response with ANY audio signal to make it sound like it was produced in that room. Without popping out your computer, it may just be easier to just listen to all other sounds in the room. As security is fussing at you for just randomly clapping, notice how his voice also lingers and decays in the same way as it did with your clap. Conceptually (through the shifting property of impulses) you can imagine the security guard's voice as a bunch of claps, scaled at different volumes\/amplitudes and pushed together into a continuous stream of audio. Since the reverb of this room is an LTI system, each of these infinitesimally close claps that come out of the guards mouth experiences the same impulse response and each is superimposed onto the previous resulting in that distinct sustain-decay that you are hearing with all audio in the room. This same superposition applies with the by-standard's voice that chime in, talking over the security guard to come to your defense as a sophomore signal processor. Both voices blend together and decay in the same manner, adding onto each other. As you have just likely spaced-out for indistinct amount of time, the guard's anger would have likely mellowed to concern as he escorts you out of the building, but at least you now have a reference for convolution, so that's good.<br \/>\n\t\t <\/li>\n\t\t<li>:: As tools, the Fourier Transforms and Fourier Series can be seen as either characterizing and mapping the distribution of a given signal's energy and phase over the the frequency domain or characterizing the frequency response of a system. The latter example can be seen with an LTI system if we take x(t) = exp( j \\omega t) as our input. Our output would be some shifted and scaled complex exponential at the same frequency y(t) = A(\\omega) exp(j (\\omega t + \\theta(\\omega))) =  A(\\omega)exp(j\\theta(\\omega))exp(j\\omega t) where the shift and gain are likely to vary with frequency. We can then combine these terms into the amplitude gain A(\\omega) and phase-shift exp(j\\theta(\\omega)) into a complex number characterizing our &quot;frequency response&quot; H(j\\omega) = A(\\omega)exp(j\\theta(\\omega)). The Fourier Transform is this same process, but simplified by ignoring the part of the output signal that matches the input in favor of just looking at how the complex gain is applied, which allows us conceptually to understand how systems alter the frequency components of signals both for design purposes (e.g. making\/visualizing a Low-Pass\/High-Pass Filter or speech processing system) or analyzing properties of the system (e.g. Identifying the timbre of an instrument or resonant frequency of a bridge). Counter intuitively, an true impulse, modelled as a dirac delta, represents a scaled sum of all complex exponentials, coupling with a constant in the frequency domain, meaning that the Fourier Transform of the impulse response of a given LTI system characterizes the whole Frequency Response of a system. General terms you may hear to describe a system's frequency response are Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, Band-Stop\/Notch, and All-Pass filtering, which each describe the magnitude response into which frequency signals are Passed (non-attenuated) or Stopped (attenuated). For instance, a Low-Pass Filter passes Low Frequency signals while stopping High Frequency signals.<br \/>\n\t\t<br \/>\n\t\tThrough similar logic, this method can be applied in reverse -- imagine a complex system  h(t) = exp( j \\omega t) where you have a knob that sets \\omega to any frequency you choose. By sweeping \\omega across the range of all frequencies you choose, you are effectively probing your input signal x(t) to check which frequencies resonate, amplify, attenuate, or delay your given signal. This is a &quot;sweep test&quot; and is similar to the way that many old oscilliscopes would *estimate* the spectra of your signals. This gain\/delay quantification as a function of frequency is again synonymous with the Fourier Transform (or spectra) of that given signal. You can think of this more generally as the &quot;fingerprint&quot; or recipe of that given signal that breaks it down into components showing &quot;how much&quot; of each elementary signal (sinusoids\/complex exponentials) is required to make our original signal. With other transforms, such as the Laplace or Mellin Transform, your signal is broken down in reference to other elementary signals, but the recipe idea remains the same. By breaking down our signals in this way, we are not only able to analyze them more directly (e.g. visualizing what part of our signal is lost when applying a low pass filter) but also  we can simplify different complex mathematics concepts\/operations (e.g. use multiplication instead of convolution).<br \/>\n\t\t<br \/>\n\t\tAs a side note, we generally talk about this as a time-frequency relationship, but this transform doesn't actually care about units in a general sense. Any parameter that you provide and return your input expressed in inverse units. If you supply a shape that is expressed in meters, it will return an interpretation of that shape in terms of inverse meters (e.g. wavenumbers in k-space). Effectively, you are taking the your initial parameter's number line and inverting it. Things that were &quot;skinny&quot; become &quot;fat&quot; and vice versa. This may be a little abstract, but personally, this understanding has helped me with more sanity checks than I'd like to admit.<br \/>\n\t\t<br \/>\n\t\tIn a similar vain, the Fourier Series is really just a special case of the Fourier transform that we use with periodic signals. Since we know that periodic signals can only be comprised of signals that share a period with it, our frequency search is restricted to only constants (DC-value) and exponentials\/sinusoids that are harmonic with out analyte signal, forming as a set of spikes\/impulses in the frequency domain. Further, rather than expressing this continuously as an impulse train, we can express this discretely as purely the gain factors applied to each constituent harmonic, and for ease of use, change our units to be relative to our fundamental frequency (k=1 harmonic). Voila, Fourier Series. <br \/>\n\t\t<br \/>\n\t\tAs a little bonus, we like the Fourier Transform since the parameter of Frequency has some tangible physical meaning -- for instance, if you were to look at the spectrum for any major chord, you'd notice the largest spikes spaced at your base note frequency (e.g. A4 = 440Hz or 880pi), major third (e.g. C4# = ~554Hz or (800pi)*2^(4\/12)), and major fifth (e.g. E4 = ~659Hz or (800pi)*2^(7\/12) ). Depending on the timbre and specific harmonic frequency response of that instrument, you may have other harmonics pop up, but those 3 notes will end up being the most prolific if a major chord is struck. Also note that as volume\/loudness is a log measure of amplitude, we perceive frequency in logarithmic units as &quot;pitch&quot; where each octave has frequency double that of its predecessor, and in western music theory that follows equal temperament, 12 chromatic notes are divided into that region. This has to do partially with a phenomenon called &quot;Weber's law&quot; and JND and partially with resonance and the mechanics of how our cochlea functions.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>"},{"author":"Chance Fleeting","siteId":"7b6f159b-754e-4dda-845e-e04499d4973b","id":"baf96137-f2d7-46f9-9173-7c740fb5c7ef","title":"Seriously.

Even though most real-world signals are analog, pretty much all of the signal processing that is done on your computers is handled discretely. On our digital devices, we can only collect data at discrete time intervals, denoted by the sampling period (T<sub>s<\/sub>) and the sampling frequency, or sampling rate rate, (f<sub>s<\/sub> = 1\/T<sub>s<\/sub>).<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>What is aliasing?\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>While sampling is a great tool for discrete signal processing, as you may guess, it can come at a cost since we cannot represent our entire signal through an infinite amount of points. Drawing from your signal processing knowledge, here’s a reason why:<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Sampling is modeled by multiplying your time-domain signal x(t) with an impulse train s(t) spaced by T<sub>s<\/sub>, your sampling period. Thinking back to the duality and Fourier Transform properties, we know that multiplication in time is equivalent to convolving in the frequency domain. Because of impulse train properties and cool math, we find that the frequency spectrum of our sampled signal X(jω) will look like shifted scaled identical copies (“replicas”) of our original signal spectra centered at integer multiples of our sampling frequency.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>You can see that our results may change depending on the frequency you sample at. If the sampling frequency is too low, you’ll get overlap between your replicas, which is the root cause of aliasing and results in a distorted reconstruction of your original signal. How can we avoid this?<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Band-limiting your signal\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A common technique to avoid overlap in the frequency domain is to band-limit your input signal with an analog low pass filter (aLPF), which we creatively call an Anti-Aliasing Filter. But, arbitrarily cutting off high-frequency signals will definitely put us at risk for losing information; besides, how would we know what cut-off frequency to use? <\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>The Nyquist Criterion\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>f<sub>max<\/sub> ≤ f<sub>s<\/sub>\/2<\/strong>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Our cutoff frequency should be picked so that it is less that half of the sampling frequency. <\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Also,<strong> f<sub>s<\/sub> ≥ 2f<sub>max<\/sub><\/strong>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>This states that the sampling rate should be at least twice the bandwidth of the signal's waveform being sampled. Sampling faster than this rate assures that the waveform can be reconstructed accurately!<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>So there we go, f<sub>s<\/sub>\/2 is our cut off, or we just have to pick a higher sampling rate (more expensive) to work with.

Again, you should NOT prioritize that over HW5, but it is an opportunity to gain some points and get more familiar with some mathematical skills that are required (or at least helpful) in this class. The last part of the assignment goes a little beyond the scope of the course, but introduces a short-cut that will benefit you GREATLY if you get stuck with a &quot;bad integral&quot;.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAgain, the extra credit is NOT required. HW5 is more important. However, partial completion is eligible for partial credit and your effort\/growth is our priority over correct answers. It is a difficult assignment, but I'd encourage you to attempt it, especially if the math content of this course is presenting a barrier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Speaking of HW5, I'm working with the TAs and instructors to find some useful hints and adjustments. Currently, we don't plan on changing the base material in the assignment, but a new version may come out soon with explicit hints and adjusted notation to help you on your way. In the mean time, you should be fine to start the assignment. &quot;Skip&quot; the questions on which you get stuck and come back to them later, possibly from a different angle, please take full advantage of the equation sheets and properties you will be covering in Problem 1, and finally, COME TO OFFICE HOURS or POST ON EDSTEM.<\/p>\n\n<p>First useful hint: The Fourier Transform does not exist for all signals. If  the Fourier Transform does not converge (barring Dirac delta functions), the Fourier Transform may not exist. In Laplace Language, this implies a pole on the imaginary axis, and would represent an unstable system. This is important to keep in mind for 1 (and only 1) signal that is included in HW5 Problem 2... &quot;DNE&quot; is an allowed answer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, we want to help, and an open forum is definitely the best place to ask question.

Since in engineering, and particularly in signal processing, our concepts are founded in the basis of math, this content is unavoidable. As you practice you may find simplification methods, such as leveraging properties, symmetries, and common identities, help mitigate the rigor of this mathematical content and find your preferred method of operation in solving signals processing problems. Homework provides this practice.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nCalculus II is a prerequisite for this course via ECE110, so there is an expectation that the students have a foundational knowledge and understanding of integration and summation. The ability to use single dimensional change of variable\/basis (u-sub) and integration-by-parts is necessary in this course if you are computing solutions manually, and both of these methods are still listed in the standard Calculus II curriculum.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWithin the scope of this class, much of our material, including but not limited to convolution, P\/E, Fourier Series, Fourier Transform, Correlation, Laplace Transforms, and so on, inherently requires integration at least at the beginning steps. Once students develop a mathematical &quot;intuition&quot; thorough practicing the math, that allows them to leverage the other material that they have at their disposal. For instance, once you are familiar with your Fourier Transform, you can bypass convolution by moving into the frequency domain, multiply the frequency responses and return to the time domain. However, as you can see this requires experience with the Fourier Transform.<br \/>\n <\/p>\n\n<p>With that, it is important to recognize that based on the nature of the upcoming material involving frequency domain analysis, sampling theory, communication application, and the Laplace Transform, the integration content is likely to increase. It is unavoidable without shorting your education and causing you to be ill-prepared moving forward.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTo that end, <strong>**Dr. Collins has authorized me to extend the due date for HW5 by 1 week (now due 10:05 am 03\/29\/2022) and I am putting together a math primer extra-credit assignment**<\/strong> that should help you become more prepared and comfortable with the Calculus II material that will be required with the topics that are just on the horizon, specifically referencing integration-by-parts, change of basis\/variable, FTC, geometric sums, and arithmetic sums, as well as &quot;tricks&quot; such as horizontal\/vertical decomposition, exploitation of symmetry, and signal manipulation, that may be helpful. I am writing it now, and I hope to have it reviewed and available asap. Note that this will not be covering application-specific properties or identities that are readily available in your equation sheet packet. If you would like to discuss and practice those, please feel free to visit any of our office hours. We would be more than happy to help you with those.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis assignment will be sharing the 03\/29\/2022 due date and time with HW5, but is currently ineligible for extension or late submission since it is Extra-Credit and I will be aiming to release the solution immediately after the deadline. Partial credit is permitted, however, so do your best. So long as you don't do it in-place of HW5, It can only help you. The current plan is to include it with equal weight as all other HW assignments, but not include it in the denominator for grade calculation.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFinally, I want you all to know that. We are here, we are listening. We would not be here doing this if your success was not paramount to us, and that includes your well-being. For many of us, it wasn't that long ago that we were in your shoes, and while conditions have changed in that time, we still try to understand. We are aware that this is a relatively stressful and confusing time in your lives. That is definitely within our consideration. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to help, and our door is always open. I am just an email away, and I am confident that it is the same with the other members of Team 280.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPlease always feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or concerns. I am here.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nKind Regards,<br \/>\nChance<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>P.S. Please try to start HW5 ASAP if you not already done so. It is very similar to HW4, but may be more involved mathematically just based on the nature of the Fourier Transform. We want you to have time to ask questions and seek help if needed. Much of the material past this point will build on the Fourier Transform. AGAIN, I am here if you need any assistance.<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>"},{"author":"Woojin Kim","siteId":"44632a57-b06e-4714-93a1-76e12d441c5a","id":"14a5bf48-16db-42da-8ec9-64ac1449aa08","title":"Today office hour starts at 5PM, not 4PM.","createdOn":1647265484875,"courseTitle":"MATH 230","body":"<p>Dear students,<\/p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the short notice, but my office hour today will be 5-6pm, not 4-6pm.

Background on Image Processing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>We’ve been working with 1-D signals and systems to process stock data, digital audio, etc. but these concepts can be extended into 2-D signals, like images. Instead of creating your signal with an array, your image signal will be a matrix, where each element represents a pixel and contains information about its corresponding intensity. And now, rather than doing 1-D convolution to transform your signal, you will now perform 2-D convolution to process the signal, which still consists of flipping and sliding (but now doing all of this in two directions). Digital image processing is typically done after the formation of your image to reduce noise and other distortions. It is also the basis for things you may see and use often, like Instagram filters, contrast enhancement, HDR, image segmentation, and so much more!<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Image Processing Lab<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For your lab, you will explore how to display grayscale and color images using MATLAB and play around with common filters (box, Gaussian, and Prewitt just to name a few). Prior to coming into lab, please<strong> DOWNLOAD THE IMAGE PROCESSING TOOLBOX<\/strong> in MATLAB. You can find this in the “HOME” tab, clicking “Add-Ons,” and searching for &quot;image processing&quot;.<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5. How to get out of lab faster...<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is a lengthier lab. There are eight exercises in total with many examples interspersed, so having a general understanding of the lab beforehand will help things run more smoothly. The lab is split into <strong><em>EXERCISES,<\/em><\/strong> which you need to submit, and <strong><em>EXAMPLES,<\/em><\/strong> which you do not need to submit but walking through them will greatly help you to complete the exercises. I would <u>HIGHLY recommend completing the examples at home before coming into lab<\/u>. This just entails copy-pasting the examples from <a href=\"https:\/\/pundit.pratt.duke.edu\/wiki\/ECE_280\/Imaging_Lab_1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Pratt Pundit<\/strong><\/a> and trying to understand them. Use the lab time to ask your TA questions about the exercises.

Four BIG things are addressed in this email, so read it through carefully!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>First, <\/strong>I've extended the music competition poll deadline to close this Friday at midnight! It's a really close race and your vote could make a huge impact! You can find the poll on Sakai under the Polls tab.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Second,<\/strong> this week in lab, we will be taking our first leap into communications, specifically with dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) encoder\/decoder systems. Here's an introduction for the lab, and a general overview can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1qVOLVxVjWxIWcQhxhpDhp03HJiIZLq83\/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112693482737053776532&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p>1.     <em>What is a Touchtone Phone?<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Back in the day, directly following rotary dials (IWF) and required operator assistance, AT&amp;T in 1963 decided to put all the buttons on single touch pad grid, and coin it the &quot;Touchtone Phone&quot;. You'd recognize this if you have ever seen a phone with physical buttons on your parent's old flip phone. The buttons on this grid would each activate two sinusoidal tone generators (added via superposition), which would each be tuned to specific frequencies that are all non-harmonic, but well-spaced between 500 and 2000 Hz. These tones would be picked up on the phone microphone and received on the &quot;operator&quot; side. These signals would be interpreted by a machine, not a human operator. This paved the way for many advancements such as more immediate and less demanding operations and even birthed the automated assistant system. In June 15, 2006, the last DTMF system in the US was taken down. Although the system is no longer used for telecommunications, the concepts of correlation and pattern recognition are EVERYWHERE. For example, if you are interested in deep learning and neural networks, similar concepts are deployed to identify features in images.<\/p>\n\n<p>2.  <em>   (CROSS) CORRELATION<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Correlation can be used to detect and characterize signals. It is the cousin of convolution and does provide some <strong>very<\/strong> useful things to us as signal processors. You can use <span style=\"\">xcorr(x,y) in MATLAB to implement cross-correlation. The math behind correlation is in the lab documentation and in the slides. Please <\/span><strong style=\"\">READ THE LAB DOCUMENTATION <\/strong>before coming in!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Third<\/strong>, Lab 3 is due this week before your corresponding lab section. There is no extension required for this lab report.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, <\/strong>Lab 2 grades will be released shortly, but first, the other TAs and I have compiled some feedback based on the quality of lab reports we have been receiving. Starting with lab 4 reports, we will dock points if we continue to see issues in the professionalism of lab reports. These include first-person usage, misassigned pages, not providing evidence to back up claims, and missing extension sections. I know this all may seem harsh but remember that the TAs are on your side. We want you all to not only build your ability to solve signals problems but also build your ability to clearly and successfully communicate with others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Like always, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns, and enjoy Lab 4 this week! This is definitely my favorite lab so I hope you all enjoy it.<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>Sanika<\/p>"},{"author":"Woojin Kim","siteId":"44632a57-b06e-4714-93a1-76e12d441c5a","id":"dd97f4f2-bdf1-4617-a402-09a873ee034f","title":"Midsemester survey","createdOn":1645718842878,"courseTitle":"MATH 230","body":"<p>Dear students,<\/p>\n\n<p>I and the Department of Mathematics value your feedback.

They count for the last 7% of your lab grade to go from 93% to 100%. We really want to see independent thought. Just asking questions you found intriguing isn't enough. We want to see you all <strong>engaging<\/strong> with figures, data, or creating models and plots. In lab 2 for example, a good extension might be applying the moving average filter you built for exercise 5 to a new data set, like Duke Covid tracker data, and\/or experimenting with using more or fewer points in your model (I.e. testing the difference between a 3 point moving average filter and an 8 point moving average filter). In your extension section, you should show plots and also explain what is happening in them\/any interesting behavior to get full credit. We are looking forward to seeing what you come up with in future labs!<\/p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>First Person Usage<\/strong> - For these lab reports, we noticed a lot of 1st person tense usage. Please do not use 1st person tense in these reports in the future. We really want you to become better writers from doing these lab reports so please be professional in your writing!<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>As a reminder, please, please, please show up to your lab sections on time. <u><strong>Failure to attend your section on time will result in a 50% penalty on your lab reports. <\/strong><\/u> Please be respectful of your classmate's and TA's time.
